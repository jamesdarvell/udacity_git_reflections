When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  If I was collaborating with others
  Also, I would use this as a backup
  I would use this as a way to build a portfolio

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
   Because I may need to manually resolve merge conflicts
   Because I can understand all of the upline changes and why they were made
   in the context of the code that I am working on

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?
   Branch
      A different version of the project within a repo, for instance, an
      experimental version or a new feature.

      I would use this if i were adding a new feature or fixing a bug

   Clone
      A copy of an existing repo
      I would use this when collaborating, or if I were using another project
      as a starting point for a new one.

   Fork
      A copy of a github repo, itself hosted on Github
      
      I would use this if I wanted to modify an open source project for my own
      use.
