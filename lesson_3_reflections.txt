When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  If I was collaborating with others
  Also, I would use this as a backup
  I would use this as a way to build a portfolio

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
   Because I may need to manually resolve merge conflicts
   Because I can understand all of the upline changes and why they were made
   in the context of the code that I am working on
