# Udacity Git Reflections
## Reflections on the Udacity Git Course

These are notes I took when taking a Udacity Course on Git and Github.  
The instructors wanted us to keep notes in a public repo, so we could compare 
them with other students.

I keep them around because they are useful insights and because other students 
can use them too.

It's a great course, by the way!  Check it out
