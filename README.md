# Udacity Git Reflections
##Reflections on the Udacity Git Course

These are notes I took when taking a Udacity Course on Git and Github.  
The instructors wanted us to keep notes in a public repo, so we could compare them with other students.

I keep them around because they are useful insights and because other students can use them too.
